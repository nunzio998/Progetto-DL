**Data**: **Re ne wable Ene rgy Community (REC) e ne rgy manage me nt** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108590 ![ref2]

The  dataset  reports  data  of  the  prosumers’ (producers+consumers) energy dynamics for a period of 1 year. 

The  consumption  related  to  50  households  and  1  public building  is  reported,  separated  for  each  consumer  and  for different appliances. 

The  energy  production  is  reported  for  the  entire  REC, consisting in 15 photovoltaic panels. 

The  REC  is  provided  with  a  fuel  cell  to  store  the  electricity charge  or  to  provide  power,  and  the  buying/selling  to  the  grid happens  with  a  different  pricing  depending  on  the  time  of  the day. 

**Tas k:** 

to  develop  a  deep  learning  application  to  deal  with  the **pre dic tion  of  e ne rgy  c ons umption  and  photovoltaic ![ref2]ge ne ration** of the entire Renewable Energy Community (REC), exploiting  a  **Fe de rate d  Le arning**  approach  for  the  prediction of the photovoltaic production. 

To  exploit  the  above  mentioned  predictions  to  develop  an optimal  strategy  for  battery  management  using **Re inforc e me nt Le arning** in order to maximize the economical reward achieved buying energy from the provider or by selling the photovoltaic-produced energy to the grid. 

Data from the **1s t half of the ye ar c an be us e d to train** the predictive  models,  and  data  from  the  2nd  half  of  the  year can be used to **e valuate the pe rformanc e .**

**Tas k**: Automatic text classification for categorization of patents into areas of Intellectual Property

**Rationale** : Patent classification is one of the areas in Intellectual Property Analytics (IPA), and a growing use case since the number of patent applications has been increasing worldwide.

**Datas e t**: The dataset (--> https://huggingface.co/datasets/big\_patent) consists of a large amount of documents, grouped by 8 (or 9) categories. Each document presents a long text and its abstract.

**Challe nge s & ide as** :

Imbalancement of the dataset: there are classes with fewer examples than others. Data size: what happens at varying number of training samples.

Are modern Large Language Models better than traditional NLP pipelines for the task? Can exploiting long texts lead to better models?
